# FRC 167 Documentation
![](https://github.com/dominicrutk/docs/workflows/gh-pages/badge.svg)
This repository serves as documentation for Iowa City Robotics \(FRC Team 167\).
Although these docs are publicly available for other teams to use, they are primarily intended for internal use.
As such, some common practices might apply mostly to FRC Team 167.

The compiled book is available [here](https://dominicrutk.github.io/docs/).
Alternatively, the Markdown source files are available [here](./src/SUMMARY.md).
