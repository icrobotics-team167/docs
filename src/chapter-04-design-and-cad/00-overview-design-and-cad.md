# Design and CAD

This chapter will identify lots of useful resources for learning CAD (computer-aided design). Firstly, it will cover using Onshape (our team's CAD system of choice). This includes making parts, versioning documents, and collaborating. Then, it will discuss FRC-specific CAD such as designing a drivetrain or an intake.

For many of you, this will be your first time working in CAD (at least since eighth grade). Accordingly, the chapter is designed for absolute beginners. If you have significant experience with another CAD system (e.g. Inventor, Fusion 360, SOLIDWORKS, etc.) and/or Git, you will breeze through the Onshape tutorials. If you have prior Onshape experience, you can probably skip straight to the FRC-specific [sections](03-installing-mkcad-and-frc-featurescripts.md).

After covering CAD, this chapter will discuss some important design principles. This includes general discussions of different subsystems as well as specific lessons learned from past mistakes.
