# FRC 167 Documentation

Hi there! My name is Dominic, and I'm the primary author of this book. I've been on FRC Team 167 since 2018, and I'll graduate from the team in 2021. On the team, my main role has been the leader of the software subteam, but I've also expanded into business roles.

In writing this book, I have two main motivations:

With each graduating class, it seems like our team loses lots of collective knowledge. This limits the success of the team in the future since members spend time relearning concepts and repeating mistakes of the past. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this effect by limiting the time experienced members have to train new members and robbing everyone of experience. Since I am graduating soon, I want to stop that from happening to new team members.

In addition, certain subteams on our team regularly have trouble teaching new team members. In particular, the programming subteam struggles to teach new members how to code when lots of people come in with absolutely zero experience. This causes many new members to quit the team because they struggle to find a role for themselves. Fixing this will promote the long-term health of the team.

To solve these issues, I've created this book. It is an ever-expanding record of how different parts of our team operate and what people need to know to succeed. The goal is to teach new members how to be useful on the team and to prevent knowledge from being lost when old members graduate.

Since this book is primarily intended for internal use by team 167, there might be some sections that do not apply to other teams. Nevertheless, the vast majority of the book's content should be applicable to most FRC teams. So, if you'd like to use this book as a resource for your team, feel free.

Whenever possible, chapters in this book are self-contained. For instance, the [Java Basics](chapter-01-java-basics/00-overview-java-basics.md) chapter doesn't rely on knowledge from any other chapters. In fact, it could be used by someone learning Java outside of an FRC context. However, a few chapters rely heavily on others. For example, knowledge of Java and the FRC control system is necessary for understanding the chapter on [FRC Programming](). When it is the case that one chapter relies on another, it will be noted in the chapter overview.

I hope you find this book useful! If you'd like to contribute, it is open-source. Check out the section on [contributing](contribute.md) for more information.
