# FRC 167 Documentation

Hi there! My name is Dominic, and I'm the primary author of this book. I've been on FRC Team 167 since 2018, and I'll graduate from the team in 2021. On the team, my main role has been software lead, but I've also expanded into business roles.

With each graduating class, it seems like our team loses lots of collective wisdom. Since I am graduating soon, I want to stop that from happening. In addition, certain subteams on our team regularly have trouble teaching new team members what they do. In particular, the programming subteam struggles to teach new members how to code when lots of people come in with absolutely zero experience. This causes many new members to quit the team because they struggle to find a role for themselves.

To solve these issues, I've created this book. It is an ever-expanding record of how different parts of our team operate and what people on each part need to know to succeed. The goal is to teach new members how to be useful on the team and to prevent knowledge from being lost when old members graduate.

Since this book is intended for internal use by team 167 first and foremost, there might be some sections that do not apply to other teams. However, the vast majority of the book's content should be perfectly applicable to most FRC teams. So, if you'd like to use this book as a teaching resource, feel free.

Whenever possible, chapters in this book are self-contained. For instance, the [Java Basics](chapter-01-java-basics/00-overview-java-basics.md) chapter doesn't rely on knowledge from any other chapters. In fact, it could be used by someone learning Java outside of an FRC context because it contains very few references to FRC. However, a few chapters rely heavily on others. For example, knowledge of Java and the FRC control system is necessary for understanding the chapter on [FRC Programming](). When it is the case that one chapter relies on another, it will be announced in the overview of the reliant chapter.

To wrap up the introduction, feel free to use this book however you see fit, but remember that it is primarily for use by team 167, and that may guide its content. Nevertheless, if you'd like to contribute to the book, it is open-source. Check out the [section on contributing](contributing.md) for more information.
