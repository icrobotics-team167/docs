## FRC CAD Tutorials

Many people in the FRC community provide fantastic tutorials about designing robot subsystems with Onshape. In particular, [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxXndvNn_JrJrHks3BxPBEWWAsVOR93kN) by Nick Aarestad of team 2220 showcases how to design a drivetrain and an intake.

You should watch the videos in order and follow along on your own computer. You will almost certainly have to pause and repeat parts of the videos frequently, but you will learn a lot about how to efficiently design robots in Onshape.
