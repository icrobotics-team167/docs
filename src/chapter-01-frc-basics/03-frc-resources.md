## FRC Resources

The FRC community is full of wonderful resources made available for free. These include workshops, forums, tutorials, and more. Many teams create their own resources for everyone to use, and there are also lots of resources maintained by the community collaboratively. Taking advantage of these resources is one of the best ways to improve as a team. Below are some great resources from the community that cover all sorts of topics. Resources specific to certain topics such as programming will be included in the relevant chapters.

If you don't want to look at all these resources, the most important ones to check out are the official resources, Chief Delphi, and The Blue Alliance.
